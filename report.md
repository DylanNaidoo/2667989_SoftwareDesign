This lab required us to create a repository on Github named 2667989_SoftwareDesign, we then needed to create the files:
-created student-info.txt: This file contained my student ID and name.
-index.html and populated it with "Hello World, I am 2667989".
 When committing i used the commit message  "feat: Initial commit with student files".
-I added the paragraph to index.html with a unique and specific commit message.
