This lab required us to create a repository on Github named 2667989_SoftwareDesign, we then needed to create the files:
<br>-created student-info.txt: This file contained my student ID and name.
<br>-index.html and populated it with "Hello World, I am 2667989".
 When committing i used the commit message  "feat: Initial commit with student files".
<br>-I added the paragraph to index.html with a unique and specific commit message.
<br>-Added hyperlink and paragraph stating its a reference.
<br>-Created 'feature/student-details' branch.
<br> Repo put into file 2667989-submission.bundle
